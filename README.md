# 🎬 **Anime Data Extraction & ETL Pipeline** 🍥

**Welcome to the ultimate anime data adventure!** 🎉 In this project, I built an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to collect and process data for over 500 anime titles from the **Jikan API** (powered by MyAnimeList). Whether you’re an anime enthusiast, a data science lover, or just curious about how to fetch data from an API like a pro, you’ve come to the right place!

## 🚀 **What is this Project About?**

Anime, meet Python. 🐍
This project allows you to **extract** a treasure trove of anime data, **transform** it into a neat and clean dataset, and **load** it into a DataFrame for further exploration.

Here’s what we’re extracting from the API (you know, all the good stuff):

- **Anime Name** 📺
- **Status** 🏁
- **Description/Synopsis** 📜
- **Aired Dates** 📅
- **Episodes & Seasons** 🍿
- **Production Studio** 🏭
- **Score** ⭐

And much more... like an anime buffet! 🍣

## 🧑‍💻 **How Does It Work?**

### **1. Extracting Data**  
I’ve hooked up to the **Jikan API** to get the top anime rankings. We pull 500 anime IDs in one go by navigating through the **pagination** like a true anime adventurer. 🧳

### **2. Transforming Data**  
From raw API responses, we clean up the data, fill in any missing values, and format everything so it’s pretty and ready for analysis. You’ll get anime details like:
- **Anime Title** (Do you recognize your favorite?)
- **Status** (Is it airing, finished, or dropped?)
- **Description** (The anime you need in your life!)
- **Total Episodes & Seasons** (How much time will it take to binge-watch?)

### **3. Loading Data**  
Once the data is transformed into a pandas DataFrame (yes, we’re making it table-ready! 🧑‍🍳), we export the result to a CSV file. All the juicy anime details in one neat table!

## 📥 **How to Get Started**

### Step 1: Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anime-data-etl-pipeline.git
```

### Step 2: Install the dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3+ installed. Then, install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the script
Run the main Python script to start fetching anime data and building your DataFrame:

```bash
python anime_etl_pipeline.py
```

Let it run, and soon you’ll have a CSV file filled with your favorite anime data! 💾

## ⚡ **Why is This Project Awesome?**

- **Data Engineering Skills**: I got hands-on with ETL workflows, API integration, and pandas for data manipulation.
- **API Fun**: Fetching data from a real-world API (Jikan) to build a structured dataset.
- **Anime Love**: Show your passion for anime and data in one project! 🤩

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: To interact with the Jikan API, process data, and handle transformations.
- **pandas**: For storing and manipulating anime data in a DataFrame.
- **Jikan API**: The heart of this project, providing all the anime details.
- **CSV**: Storing the final results for future analysis or visualization.

## ✨ **Future Enhancements (The Sequel!)**

- **Add more anime sources**: Maybe from other APIs or different anime platforms.
- **Data Analysis**: Dive deeper into the dataset—plot anime scores, compare genres, or create anime recommendation systems.
- **Web Interface**: Build a fun dashboard to display the top anime and show user stats.
